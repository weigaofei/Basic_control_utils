# Basic_control_utils
**some common utils in controller designing**  
1. linear invariant time system's stable criterion、controllability、oberservabilty、discrete  
2. non-linear system's linearization about a fixed point or a local trajectory  
3. solve discrete and continous LQR  
4. solve pseudo inverse by SVD or common tranpose and inverse formula  
5. some common functions about SE3's transform  
6. standard kalman filter  

**usage**  
  - [ ] mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make  
  - [ ] ./lqr_test
